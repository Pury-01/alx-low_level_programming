This project is about bit manipulation
It deals:- with converting binary number to an int.
         - printing binary representation of a number.
         - function tha t returns the value of a bit at a given            index.
         - function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given           index
         - function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given           index.
         - function that returns the number of bits you would              need to flip to get from one number to another
         - function that checks the endianness
         - finding password of a program
